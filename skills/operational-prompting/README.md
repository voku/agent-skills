# Operational Prompting

Repo-owned operational prompting for coding agents. 8 rules across 4 categories.

**Version:** 1.0.1

## Overview

This skill provides guidance for:
- Replacing persona-heavy mega-prompts with repo-owned instruction files
- Layering agent rules across global, repo, path, and task scopes
- Defining exact validation commands and stopping conditions
- Requiring evidence-first summaries instead of theatrical process narration
- Publishing portable, vendor-neutral skill manifests in YAML
- Keeping tool-coupled skills and machine-readable resources in the repository that owns the tool

## Ownership boundary

This collection owns tool-neutral engineering guidance. If a skill invokes, configures, or depends on a specific tool's CLI, API, schema, output contract, file layout, or runtime behavior, its canonical instructions belong in that tool's repository so code and coding instructions are reviewed and released together. Link or install that tool-owned skill instead of keeping a second canonical copy here.

## Categories

### 1. Repo-Owned Control (Critical)
Keep durable agent behavior in repository files and define an instruction hierarchy.

### 2. Task Contracts (Critical)
Limit edits to the smallest affected scope and stop when requirements are unclear.

### 3. Validation & Evidence (High)
Bind work to exact commands, deterministic outputs, and auditable summaries.

### 4. Portability (Medium)
Publish portable skill manifests for Copilot, Codex, Claude, Gemini, and similar tools.
