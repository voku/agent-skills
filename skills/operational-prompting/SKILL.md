# Operational Prompting

Modern coding-agent control for repository-bound work. Contains 8 rules across 4 categories for repo-owned instructions, instruction hierarchy, scope contracts, validation contracts, evidence output, machine-readable workflows, stopping conditions, and vendor-neutral skill manifests.

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:
- Designing repository instructions for coding agents
- Migrating a giant custom prompt into repo-owned files
- Defining AGENTS.md, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, or `*.instructions.md`
- Writing portable skill manifests or task-specific command recipes
- Tightening task boundaries, validation loops, or review output

## Maintenance Discipline

- Edit the canonical repo-owned instruction source first, not installed, copied, or generated derivatives.
- Regenerate machine-readable manifests or compiled prompt artifacts only when the interface-facing metadata actually changed.
- After changing repo-owned guidance, rerun the repository's validation and install/sync steps for the affected agent assets.
- When a durable correction appears only in chat history, memory, or review notes, promote it into the owning repo guidance instead of leaving it as tribal knowledge.
- Clean stale generated copies when a skill, prompt file, or subagent definition is renamed, merged, or retired.
- For one-off operational mutations, prefer inspect-first workflows with an explicit execute flag rather than auto-running destructive behavior by default.

## Rule Categories by Priority

| Priority | Category | Impact | Prefix |
|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Repo-Owned Control | CRITICAL | `repo-`, `hierarchy-` |
| 2 | Task Contracts | CRITICAL | `scope-`, `stop-` |
| 3 | Validation & Evidence | HIGH | `validation-`, `evidence-`, `machine-` |
| 4 | Portability | MEDIUM | `portable-` |

## Quick Reference

### 1. Repo-Owned Control (CRITICAL)

- `repo-owned-instructions` - Put durable agent rules in repository files, not persona-heavy chat prompts
- `instruction-hierarchy` - Split rules across global, repo, path, and task layers with conflict resolution

### 2. Task Contracts (CRITICAL)

- `scope-minimal-diff` - Define the smallest affected file set and prohibit unrelated edits
- `stop-ask-conditions` - Stop when ambiguity, missing facts, or unsafe assumptions appear

### 3. Validation & Evidence (HIGH)

- `validation-contracts` - Bind work to exact repo commands, order, and stop-on-failure behavior
- `evidence-output` - Report files changed, commands run, failures, and unresolved risks
- `machine-readable-first` - Prefer JSON, lint, or other deterministic output before prose summaries

### 4. Portability (MEDIUM)

- `portable-skill-manifests` - Publish vendor-neutral skill manifests and task recipes in repo-owned YAML

## Reusable Prompt Recipes

`operating-prompts.json` packages recurring operational prompting patterns for deterministic consumers such as `agent-recall-compiler`.

Most entries are **L2 recipes**, not generic execution prompts. They describe how to use the current repository context to construct one project-specific L1 operational prompt. The generated L1 shape is:

```text
Goal + Context + Constraints + Verification + Done When
```

`Verification` names the concrete measurement procedure: exact tests, static analysis, mutation testing, benchmarks, probes, or other repository-supported checks. `Done When` names the observable result those checks must produce before execution may stop. Do not collapse the two: a command is not an acceptance criterion, and an acceptance criterion without a way to measure it is decorative prose.

Keep reusable method and quality policy in the L2 recipe. Keep exact files, symbols, callers, tests, commands, architecture, and risks in the project-specific recall context.

A manifest entry declares its level explicitly:

```json
{
  "id": "coverage-mutation",
  "level": 2,
  "template": "Create a project-specific test-hardening prompt with at least {{minimum_percentage_points}} percentage points coverage growth and mutation evidence from {{mutation_command}}."
}
```

Use `level: 1` only for contracts that are genuinely context-independent, such as a final evidence-report shape or a bounded retry stop condition.

Do not hide task policy in reusable defaults. The caller supplies values such as the planning horizon, minimum adversarial probes, coverage floor, or retry limit explicitly.

Use `adversarial-review` when a project-specific review should attack a first draft from current Recall evidence. Its numeric floor counts distinct plausible failure-mode hypotheses or attack scenarios that must actually be investigated; it does **not** require that many defects to exist. A disproved hypothesis is useful falsification evidence, and `CLEAN` remains valid when the requested probes were performed without finding an evidence-backed defect. Never manufacture findings merely to satisfy the floor.

Use the context-light `agent-recall-compiler review first-draft` lens when no project-specific L2 construction pass is needed. It is the immediate review primitive; `adversarial-review` is the project-grounded L2 recipe. They share falsification semantics without duplicating ownership.

Use `reproduce-before-fix` when a bug claim must be proven before production code changes. Use `reject-and-restart` when an implementation crossed an approved boundary and repairing the existing patch would preserve a failed assumption or invalid approach.

## Essential Patterns

### Canonical-Source-First Workflow

```markdown
1. Edit the reviewed source file, not generated copies
2. Regenerate manifests or compiled assets only if needed
3. Run the repo validation commands for the changed guidance surface
4. Reinstall or resync generated agent assets
5. Remind the user about any required client reload step only when that client actually needs one
```

### Minimal Repository Contract

```markdown
# AGENTS.md

## Start here
- `README.md` for product behavior
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for repo-wide rules
- `src/` for implementation
- `tests/` for behavioral expectations

## Before editing
- Read the smallest affected file set first
- Run: composer test
- Run: composer phpstan
- Stop and ask if requirements conflict or the validation command is missing
```

### Manual Operation Contract

```markdown
## One-off operation
- Print the target objects or scope before any write step
- Default to dry-run / inspect mode
- Require an explicit `--execute` or equivalent flag for mutations
- Keep validation and rollback expectations visible in the task contract
```

### Cross-Layer Task Contract

```markdown
## Cross-layer change
- Name only the layers that actually change (data, domain, request boundary, rendering, browser flow, tests)
- Assign one owner per changed layer so instructions do not overlap
- Sequence contract-producing layers before dependent layers
- Make the handoff explicit: accepted input, produced data shape, emitted IDs/values, proving tests
```

### Specialist Routing Contract

```markdown
## Specialist routing
- Start with one primary specialist instruction set
- Add a second specialist only when the task clearly spans a second concern
- Avoid broad instruction bundles when a smaller owner can prove or implement the change
- After review or triage, hand off to the smallest proven next owner instead of escalating into another broad pass
```

### Vendor-Neutral Skill Manifest

```yaml
schemaVersion: 1
description: Repo-owned agent skills
skillSchema:
  requiredFields:
    - name
    - purpose
    - triggers
    - requiredEnvironment
    - inputs
    - commands
    - expectedOutputs
    - failureHandling
  executionNotes:
    - Execute commands from the repository root unless a skill says otherwise.
    - Resolve paths relative to the repository root.
    - Prefer deterministic, machine-readable output when available.
skills:
  - id: validate-repo
    file: .ai/skills/validate-repo.yaml
    summary: Run the repository validation suite in a stable order.
```

## How to Use

Read individual rule files for detailed explanations, anti-patterns, and copy-pasteable examples.

Each rule file contains:
- YAML frontmatter with metadata (title, impact, tags)
- Why it matters
- Bad / Better / Best examples
- Exceptions and trade-offs
- Related topics for adjacent rules

For task-level reuse, select an entry from `operating-prompts.json`, provide every required argument, and let the consuming recall layer combine it with project context.
