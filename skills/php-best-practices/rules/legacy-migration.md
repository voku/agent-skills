# Legacy Code Migration Strategy

## Why it matters

Rewriting a working legacy codebase in one large branch is one of the highest-risk activities in software engineering. The branch drifts from production, tests are missing or wrong, and the rewrite ships with a new set of bugs while the old bugs are rediscovered. Incremental migration with a safety net produces visible, verifiable progress without risking the system that is currently earning money.

## Rule

Establish a safety net first, then modernize in small automated steps. Never rewrite a working class from scratch. Use the Strangler Fig pattern to isolate legacy code behind typed interfaces so new code replaces it module by module without disrupting callers.

## Bad

```php
<?php

// DON'T: big-bang rewrite
// Copy the class, rewrite from scratch, merge weeks later, pray tests cover it

// DON'T: mix legacy and modern in the same function boundary
function processOrder($id)           // no types
{
    $order = legacy_get_order($id);  // old procedural call
    return new ModernOrderDTO(...);  // new code — incompatible styles, no type contract
}

// DON'T: suppress errors to make migration easier
$result = @legacy_function();        // hides failures that should surface

// DON'T: delete tests to speed up the migration
```

## Better

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

// Step 1: Add strict_types and basic types to the most-called class
// without changing behavior — safe mechanical improvement
final class UserService
{
    public function __construct(
        private readonly \PDO $db,
    ) {}

    public function getUser(int $id): ?array
    {
        $stmt = $this->db->prepare('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?');
        $stmt->execute([$id]);
        $row = $stmt->fetch(\PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
        return $row !== false ? $row : null;
    }
}
```

## Best

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

// Phase 1: Safety net — capture current state before touching anything
// $ vendor/bin/phpstan analyse --generate-baseline phpstan-baseline.neon
// $ vendor/bin/pest --stop-on-failure  (tests must pass before migration starts)

// Phase 2: Automated syntax modernization via Rector (dry-run first)
// $ vendor/bin/rector process src --dry-run
// rector.php:
// return RectorConfig::configure()
//     ->withPaths([__DIR__ . '/src'])
//     ->withSets([LevelSetList::UP_TO_PHP_81, SetList::TYPE_DECLARATION]);

// Phase 3: Incremental type coverage — BEFORE
class UserService
{
    function getUser($id)
    {
        return $this->db->query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $id");  // SQL injection
    }
}

// Phase 3: Incremental type coverage — AFTER
final class UserService
{
    public function __construct(
        private readonly UserRepository $repository,
    ) {}

    public function getUser(int $id): ?User
    {
        return $this->repository->find(new UserId($id));
    }

    /** @param array{name: string, email: string} $data */
    public function createUser(array $data): User
    {
        return $this->repository->create(
            name:  new UserName($data['name']),
            email: new Email($data['email']),
        );
    }
}

// Phase 4: Strangler Fig — wrap legacy behind a typed interface
interface LegacyOrderGateway
{
    /** @return array{id: int, total: float, status: string} */
    public function fetchOrder(int $id): array;
}

// Adapter delegates to legacy code
final class LegacyOrderAdapter implements LegacyOrderGateway
{
    public function fetchOrder(int $id): array
    {
        $raw = legacy_get_order($id);   // still calls old code
        return [
            'id'     => (int)    $raw['order_id'],
            'total'  => (float)  $raw['order_total'],
            'status' => (string) $raw['order_status'],
        ];
    }
}

// New service depends on the interface, not the legacy code
final class OrderService
{
    public function __construct(
        private readonly LegacyOrderGateway $gateway,
    ) {}

    public function getOrder(int $id): Order
    {
        $data = $this->gateway->fetchOrder($id);
        return Order::fromArray($data);
    }
}

// When ready, swap LegacyOrderAdapter for a real repository —
// OrderService does not change at all.
```

## Tracking migration progress

Commit a migration checklist to the repository to make progress visible:

```markdown
## Migration Progress

- [x] PHPStan baseline captured (1,423 violations at level 0)
- [x] Rector applied — PHP 8.1 syntax transformations
- [x] `declare(strict_types=1)` added to all files
- [ ] PHPStan level raised to 3 (current: 1)
- [ ] SQL injection: 12 of 34 query sites migrated to PDO
- [ ] Value objects: UserId, Email, Money created; 8 of 25 services migrated
- [ ] God class `OrderManager` (1,200 lines) → extract 4 focused classes
```

## Priority order for what to fix first

| Priority | Fix | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Add `declare(strict_types=1)` | Foundation for all subsequent type work |
| 2 | Fix SQL injection (prepared statements) | Security — immediate risk |
| 3 | Add return types to public methods | Unblocks PHPStan analysis |
| 4 | Replace untyped `array` params with shapes or value objects | Eliminates `mixed` propagation |
| 5 | Extract classes from god classes | Enables focused unit tests |
| 6 | Replace `@` suppression with proper error handling | Unmasks hidden failures |
| 7 | Raise PHPStan level one step at a time | Validates all prior work |

## Exceptions / trade-offs

- **Legacy code with no tests**: write characterization tests (golden-master tests) before touching anything. Tests that prove "this is what it currently does" are better than no tests.
- **Tight deadlines**: a PHPStan baseline is not tech debt — it is an honest inventory. Generate it, commit it, and shrink it over time. Leaving it at the initial size is tech debt.
- **Third-party integrations**: wrap them behind typed interfaces from day one. Do not let their untyped APIs bleed into your domain.

## Static-analysis notes

- **`phpstan-baseline.neon`**: generated with `--generate-baseline`, acknowledged violations that do not block CI. Shrink it sprint by sprint — treat any baseline growth as a regression.
- **PHPStan level progression**: start at level 0 for legacy, fix violations, raise by 1. The level number is an objective metric of type-safety maturity.
- **Rector** automates ~80% of mechanical transforms (constructor promotion, match expressions, typed properties). Always dry-run first; review the diff before applying.
- **`reportUnmatchedIgnoredErrors: true`** in `phpstan.neon` ensures stale `@phpstan-ignore` comments are flagged when the underlying issue is fixed.
