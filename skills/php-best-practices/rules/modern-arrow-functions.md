# Arrow Functions

## Why it matters
Verbose closures with `use` capture lists add noise that buries the actual transform. Arrow functions eliminate the `use` clause by capturing the outer scope implicitly, making simple expression-level transforms read as clearly as the math they represent. The danger is the opposite failure: packing multi-statement logic into an arrow function to avoid naming it, producing unreadable one-liners.

## Rule
Use arrow functions only for tiny, single-expression transforms with no side effects. Anything with branching, multiple statements, or side effects belongs in a named method or a regular closure.

## Bad
```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

$multiplier = 3;

// Verbose closure — $multiplier capture is boilerplate noise
$result = array_map(
    function (int $n) use ($multiplier): int {
        return $n * $multiplier;
    },
    $numbers,
);
```

## Better
```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

$multiplier = 3;

// Arrow function: outer scope captured implicitly, expression is clear
$result = array_map(
    fn (int $n): int => $n * $multiplier,
    $numbers,
);
```

## Best
```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

// GOOD: arrow function for a clean, focused transform
$multiplier = 3;
$result = array_map(fn (int $n): int => $n * $multiplier, $numbers);

// BAD: do NOT do this — complex logic forced into an arrow function
$processed = array_map(
    fn (Order $o): string => $o->isPaid()
        ? ($o->isShipped() ? 'delivered' : 'processing')
        : ($o->isCancelled() ? 'cancelled' : 'pending'),
    $orders,
);

// BETTER: extract to a named method when logic is non-trivial
$processed = array_map(fn (Order $o): string => $o->statusLabel(), $orders);
```

## Exceptions / trade-offs
- Any logic with side effects, I/O, or more than one expression — use a named method or a regular closure instead.
- Arrow functions cannot contain `return` statements; if you need early returns or guards, use a closure or a method.
- Multi-step pipelines may benefit from named methods over chained arrow functions to keep stack traces readable.

## Static-analysis notes
PHPStan and Psalm infer the return type from the arrow function body expression. Explicit return type annotations (`: int`, `: string`) are recommended for public APIs and non-obvious transforms; they are optional for trivially obvious cases.

## Version notes
`PHP 7.4+`
